I am a computer science student at cal state fullerton and I expect to graduate in 2028.

## Favorite CPCS 120L Labs
Lab 3, part 1
This was a great lab because we used std::cout to print out messages to the terminal. We also used std::cin to read values from the keyboard. We had to use the BMR scale for both men and women to get an accurate output.

Lab 6, part 1
This lab was another one of my favorites because we basically made a sandwich with code. This lab was challenging because we had to use command lines and vectors. Once it was all done the terminal read us our sandwich.

Lab 8, part 2 
This lab made us work with loops to make a pattern. It was pretty cool putting what we learned in our lectures to actual code and apply it. This lab was pretty neat.
